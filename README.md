# Test-cases

Below are some Test Case samples that I wrote while working on previous projects.



"Description"
Check if the login works when a person uses a correct user/pass.

"Steps to reproduce"
1.Go to XYZ Bank 
2. Add a correct user/pass

 "Expected result"
User should be able to login and is taken to his profile page.

"Test data"
User: irina & pass 123456




"Description"
When I click on the video file instead of getting the video, an error pops up indicating that the requested page is not available. Something along the lines of   '404 Not Found'. The browser then displays this error code. 

"Steps to reproduce"
1.Go to Home - Primaria Techirghiol 
2. Open the tab F12 and in Console appears the error'404 Not Found'.

 "Expected result"
The video file should match when I open it in a new window.

"Actual result"
An existing file it is not found. Does not match when I open it in a new window. 
It is about a video file that appears on the first page.
